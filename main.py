# Find the connected components in random graphs with the following algorithm:
# -- Start from random node and perform BFS
# -- Label the nodes that BFS visits
# -- If all nodes are visited, the network is connected
# -- Otherwise find an unvisited node and repeat BFS
# NOTE: ChatGPT is not allowed but GitHub Copilot is fine :)
